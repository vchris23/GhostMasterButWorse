# GhostMasterButWorse
 
I tried making a version of Ghost Master, a game from 2003, where you control ghosts to scare away humans in the different levels. Ghost master levels have quite a bit of story, puzzles and unique challenges baked into them, but for this project I wanted to focus on just the “scaring mortals away” part. Because of this focus, the ghost system was the main star throughout the project. 
The main parts of the game are:
•	The ghosts – spawned and controlled using the GUI, casts abilities that affect the level and humans
•	Plasma – Ghosts need to reserve plasma to be able to cast more effective abilities, plasma is a sum of the human’s terror
•	Camera – pans over the map, and pivots around a point on the level clicked on by the right mouse button. Can also go up and down
•	Humans – Mortals that walk around the level, satisfying their needs, while the ghosts scare them. Gets chased off the map when their terror meter fills up
•	Fetters/Entities – Each ghost can only be summoned on certain objects, some of these objects the humans interact with to satisfy certain needs
•	Clutter – Non-functional game objects, that aren’t a part of the actual building
